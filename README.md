# Lever-Button-Lights
A lever light? Is that a light switch? I've also created a Glass block light! The block lights itself when you hit it and if you hit again, it turns off. If it is on, it'll send a redstone signal. So if you only wanted regular glass, use that.

Code is messy. Feel free to clean it up and make a pull request. Most of what is there is for going further in the mod. 

## TODO

Create a button that toggles itself between lit and not lit and is still a button.
Create a button that flashes/pulses while waiting to be pressed, I think I can do this with particles.
Create the remaining 15 color variants of each, I might not be able to do 15 colors. So far there is one project called albedo that I could link against, but it only allows 10 lights. I'm not exactly sure what it's about. This will sadly require a lot of research.
Once I succeed with #3 above, I can work on allowing the buttons to have pulsing with frequency.
#3 thru #4 are a currently a pipe-dream. The hope is that I can pull them from dreamland.
